# Changelog

## 1.4.0

### Added
- `ModelGuide`: `summary="glance"`, a comparison strip in place of each row's effort meter.
  - Quality, reliability, speed and value (the cost score), each as five steps against the best pick shown for the task (95%, 85%, 70%, 50% of it, and below), under one set of column heads that line up with every row.
  - "Tied with #1" on a pick whose total is within the 95% intervals of #1's. "Best value" on the most quality per dollar among picks with at least 80% of the best quality.
  - A partly estimated ranking (`kind: 'estimate'`) is hatched, as `Chart` marks an estimate, and says so in the strip's accessible name. Each step's tooltip gives the figure and the best on the task.
  - With it, the effort is written out ("Thinking: High") in the detail and in a chain's steps instead of metered, because a maker's own scale says little beside another maker's.
  - Labels for translation: `glanceLabels`, `tiedLabel`, `bestValueLabel`, `thinkingLabel`.
- `ModelGuide`: `map`, in advanced mode a quality-against-price chart above the list.
  - Price is on a log scale because the picks on one task span up to 100x.
  - The picks nothing on the task beats on both are joined as the trade-off line.
  - Each dot is a keyboard-reachable control, named with rank, model, quality and price, that opens its pick.
  - Labels: `mapLabels`.
- `GuidePick.unavailable`: why a pick cannot be used from here. The use action is disabled and the reason shown beside it.
- `ModelGuide`: a sample `output` given as rendered markup (a consumer's markdown, say) gets `rr-guide__output--rich`, with its own headings, lists, tables and code blocks instead of pre-wrapped text. A plain-string output is unchanged.
- `ModelGuide`: a sample can carry a task card (`sample.card`: brief, what was given, what was asked, the limit, what makes it hard), a scorecard (`sample.scorecard`: a verdict per check, pass / partial / miss, with the passage of the answer that earned it) and run facts (`sample.run`). Such a sample reads card, scorecard, the answer folded under "Read the full answer", then the run; the exact prompt folds inside the card. The pick's row shows its score. Verdicts are said in words for screen readers, not only marked. Labels: `sampleLabels`.
- `GlanceLabels`, `GuideMapLabels`, `GuideTaskCard`, `GuideScorecard`, `GuideVerdict` and `GuideSampleLabels` types are exported.

All of these are optional and render no markup when absent, so parity with the reference is unchanged. `yarn guide:check` asserts each one and its absence.

## 1.3.1

### Fixed
- `Chart`: an axis with more points than room for a label each (thirty days on a half-width card) printed every label on top of its neighbours. It now prints every n-th label, counted back from the last point so the latest is always named, plus the hovered point. The figures table still lists every label, and a chart whose labels fit is unchanged. `yarn insights:check` covers both.

## 1.3.0

### Added
- Insights, a new group of ten analytics marks for AI-adoption views, moved in from the Crew prototype when Crew's screens moved into Console: `MixBar`, `MixColumns` and `MixKey` (an ordinal mix such as the six modes of AI use, as one bar, as columns over time, and its legend), `BulletBar` (a figure against its target and a comparison), `BarList` (groups on one scale, with a hatched, number-free row for a group under the privacy floor), `CompareBar` (one group against a wider one), `Histogram`, `HeatCell` (a compare-grid `td` shaded by distance from a baseline, unshaded within 3 points), `Delta` (a signed, direction-judged change) and `PrivacyFloor` (the lock and "Groups of 3 or more"). Plus `heatBand()` and the `MixStep`/`HeatBand` types. Every mark carries its figures as text as well, and every English default can be replaced for translation. None has a case in the reference delivery, so `yarn insights:check` (now in CI, beside `yarn shell:check`) asserts their behaviour.
- Tokens for them, light and dark: `--chart-track`, `--chart-good`, `--chart-bad`, the ordinal ramp `--ordinal-0..5` with `--ordinal-ink-0..5`, and `--heat-pos-1..3` / `--heat-neg-1..3`. On dark the ordinal ramp runs the other way, so the deepest step is still the strongest.
- `AppShell`: `onNavigate(href, event)`, called on a plain click of a nav link so an app with a client-side router (Next.js, React Router) can call `event.preventDefault()` and route itself instead of reloading the page. Clicks with a modifier key or another button stay with the browser, so opening a link in a new tab still works. Without it the links render exactly as before, with no handler.
- Console, the eighth product. `AppShell product="Console"` (or "Redrob Console") now sets `data-product="console"` instead of being dropped, and `Band product="console"` wears its grounds. Console is the Group's own product, so it takes Redrob Blue rather than an eighth hue: `--product-console-1..10` reference `--blue-1..10`, with the same wash/fill/line roles (steps 1/2/3 light, 10/9/8 dark) and `beyond` gradients as every other product. `tokens.json` and the native headers carry the 17 new tokens. The suite spectrum seam is unchanged: it already opens on the brand's own teal and blue.
- `AppShell`: `windowInset` (`top`, `end`, `endHeight`) keeps a frameless desktop window's own controls off the page - the macOS traffic lights above the sidebar brand, the Windows caption buttons at the top-right of the header (or the rail) - and `dragRegion` makes the brand row and header drag the window while their controls stay clickable. Both are off by default; a shell without them renders no new class or inline style.
- `AppShell`: `asideFolded`, what stays at the bottom of the sidebar when it is folded (or narrower than 900px) in place of `aside`, e.g. the account as an avatar-only menu button. Without it the folded shell renders as before.
- `ModelGuide`: `harnessLabel`, `rankLabel` and `effortUnit`, so the "on <harness>", "#1 for <task>" and "<level> effort" text can be translated. Without them the English defaults render as before.
- `ModelGuide`: an output select ("I need": documents, presentations, graphics...). It takes `outputs`, `output`, `defaultOutput`, `onOutputChange`, `deliverableLabel` and `anyOutputLabel`, and re-ranks each task from `picksByOutput[output][language]`.
  - It lists "Anything" plus only the outputs the current task is ranked for.
  - An output the task is not ranked for reads as "Anything".
  - A keyed output with no ranking for the working language falls back to the task's ranking.
  - The props are `deliverable*` because `outputLabel` already labels a pick's sample output.
- `ModelGuide`: benchmark picks (`GuidePick.benchmark`, `benchmarkLabel`, `benchmarkNote`). These show the same ranking on another product, for comparison.
  - The row is greyed and unranked, and takes no slot in the top `limit`.
  - It is never the pick opened by default.
  - Its detail has no use action or effort control.

The ModelGuide output and benchmark additions are optional and render no markup when absent, so parity with the reference is unchanged. `yarn guide:check` asserts both behaviours and their absence.

### Fixed
- `ModelGuide`: reflows on its own width instead of the window's (container queries, with the 900px media query kept as a fallback). In a product frame with a menu and a side panel open, the two-column grid used to stay side by side in a ~480px column, the selects ran past its edge and the effort label overlapped the ranking note. Below 880px the grid and selects stack; below 480px the pick's header puts the cost under the model name.
- `AppShell`: folded nav links show the design-system `Tooltip` (label and count) instead of a native `title`, placed against the window so the narrow sidebar cannot cut it off. The folded sidebar no longer scrolls sideways. `yarn shell:check` covers the folded state.
- Overlays are no longer cut off by the container they sit in. `Menu`, `ComposerStatus`, `ModelPicker`, `Select`, `Combobox`, `DatePicker`, `TimePicker`, `LangSwitch` and `Tooltip` now place their open overlay against the window (`position: fixed`), flip to the side with more room, slide back inside the edges and cap their height to the space they have. A `ComposerStatus` panel above a composer in the middle of an empty chat used to run off the top of its column. Closed components render the same markup as before; the placement is inline style added only while open. `yarn floating:check` covers the placement.
- `ModelGuide`: a pick with no sample run (no `task.prompt`, `sample.prompt` or `sample.output`) no longer shows empty "What it was asked" and "What it wrote" boxes.

## 1.2.0

### Added
- `ModelGuide`: a working-language select (`languages`, `language`, `defaultLanguage`, `onLanguageChange`) that switches each task to `picksByLanguage[language]`, falling back to `picks`.
- `ModelGuide`: picks that run models in sequence (`steps`, named "A → B", with each step's role and effort).
- `ModelGuide`: where each figure comes from (`kind`, `monthlyKind`: measured / published / derived / estimate), a monthly range (`monthlyRange`), tool tags with planned and missing tools (`tools`, `comingSoon`, `missingLabel`), caveats (`flags`) and a sources list (`sources`).
- Types `GuideKind`, `GuideStep`, `GuideSource`, `GuideTool`.

These go beyond the 4 October 2026 delivery, whose ModelGuide has none of them. Every one is optional and renders no markup when absent, so parity with the reference is unchanged; `yarn guide:check` (in CI) asserts their behaviour and that absence.

## 1.1.0

Brings the library to the Redrob Group Design System 2026 delivery of 4 October 2026. Nothing is removed.

### Added
- `ComposerMode`, `ProtectionStatus`, `CrossCheckSetting` (with `CrossCheckSetting.value`), `Opinion`, `ThreadNote`, `PlanQuestions`, `PlanDocument`, `FactCheckReport`, `ChallengeReport`, `AccessList`, `Meter`, `ScheduleRow`, and their prop types.
- `COMPOSER_MODES`, `CROSS_CHECKS`, `CROSS_CHECK_LEVELS`, `EffortLevel`, `EffortNoteContext`.

### Changed
- `Menu`: an icon-only trigger (`icon` without `label`, named by `ariaLabel`).
- `ModelPicker` and `ModelGuide`: effort levels a person can set on a pick (`effort`, `defaultEffort`).
- `LangSwitch`: closes on outside click and Escape; `placement="up"`, `align="left"`.
- `PostList`: `variant="section"` is the homepage news band.
- `PrivacyProtection` and `MemoryScope` head their panels with `ProtectionStatus`.
- `system.css` is the new delivery's stylesheet. `tokens.css` is unchanged.

### Deprecated (still exported in 1.x)
| Old | Use |
|---|---|
| `StatusCard` | `ProtectionStatus` (forwards to it) |
| `ScopeBadge` | `AccessList` (forwards to it) |
| `Schedule` | `ScheduleRow` |
| `SecondOpinionSetting` | `CrossCheckSetting` (now an adapter onto it: one value sets both checks, because its `rr-opset` styles are gone) |
| `CostMeter`, `MemoryMeter` | `Meter` |
| `Disputed`, `OpinionAdded` | `Opinion` |
| `ModelSwitch`, `MemorySaved` | `ThreadNote` |
| `NewsSection` | `PostList variant="section"` |
| `AvatarMark` | `Avatar` |

`yarn aliases:check` (in CI) asserts each one still exports and renders.

### Tooling
- `reference/` is the 4 October 2026 delivery. `.gitattributes` keeps it LF on Windows checkouts.
- Parity reports the 30 product screens that load a whole prototype app as not compared.
